This repository contains the source code for a C++ program that analyzes the performance of four sorting algorithms: 
Insertion Sort, Heap Sort, Merge Sort, and Quick Sort. The program measures the number of steps taken by each algorithm to sort lists of different sizes and data distributions.

Functionality:
Implements four sorting algorithms: Insertion Sort, Heap Sort, Merge Sort, and Quick Sort.
Includes a simulation program to measure the average number of steps for each algorithm on various input sizes and data distributions.
Generates random numbers and sorts them in ascending order for random input testing.
Sorts pre-sorted lists (ascending and descending) to observe best-case and worst-case scenarios.
Creates a table and graph to compare the performance of each algorithm.
Analyzes the data to answer questions about the relative performance of each algorithm.

Deliverables: ( Also Listed in details in the pdf)

1. Deliverable 1:
Four C++ programs implementing each sorting algorithm with a main function for demonstration.
Screenshots showcasing a sample run of each algorithm.
2. Deliverable 2:
A table summarizing the average number of steps for each algorithm on different input sizes (1K, 5K, 10K, 15K, 20K) for three data distributions (random, sorted ascending, sorted descending).
A graph depicting the performance of each algorithm for the three data distributions.
3. Deliverable 3: (Analysis included in the pdf)
A report containing the following analysis based on the collected data:
Which algorithm performs worst when sorting a pre-sorted list (both ascending and descending)?
Which algorithm performs best on average across all data distributions?
Justification for the observed performance based on the algorithms' characteristics.
Getting Started:
